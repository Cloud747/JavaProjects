# Academic Integrity Statement

From the syllabus: "For each project, you are expected to include a list of the people with whom you have consulted (including students, IT guides, instructors, or anyone outside of our learning community) and resources used (including webpages and source code repositories, outside of our course learning materials) as part of your project. This information should be included in a file named academic-integrity-statement.md. If you did not use any outside resources, be sure to specify that in your document."


There are documented parts where I found assistance on the Mkyong.com site. I've commented the particular sections where
I found some helpful snippets to use. Of course, these snippets were customized in my own way to fit the project requirements.

I was stuck on some weird character issue, but I was assisted by Kevin with simple troubleshooting methods. However, 
with Paula's very minor assistance :) - I was able to determined that I had hardcoded a string into one of 
the anaylzers but as soon as I placed the correct value the normal characters for the file path worked. 

Lee assisted with clarifying some of the project requirements as I was having issues interpreting it.

Most of the code entered in this project was taken from my unit 1 labs with some minor adjustments.

FOR PROJECT 2:

I was able to find quite a bit of help by searching through Stack Overflow forums and I tend to find the best examples on MKyong's websites. He really dives into the point and provides you with great ideas as not all methods and structure are going to be the same. 

I spent some time in the labs where I was able to ask questions to Tom and he was happy to help me fix a few syntax errors I had been stumbling upon. Overall, this project was nothing short of spectacular and really tested my skills. I feel as long I am building confidence and able to structure out the requirements for my assignments. Lastly, there was some test errors I had encountered when attempting to iterate through the map of values, so I asked on the #help Slack channel and was able to find some assistance in finding the answer to my issue.
