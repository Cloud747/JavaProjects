# Academic Integrity Statement

From the syllabus: "For each project, you are expected to include a list of the people with whom you have consulted (including students, IT guides, instructors, or anyone outside of our learning community) and resources used (including webpages and source code repositories, outside of our course learning materials) as part of your project. This information should be included in a file named academic-integrity-statement.md. If you did not use any outside resources, be sure to specify that in your document."


There are documented parts where I found assistance on the Mkyong.com site. I've commented the particular sections where
I found some helpful snippets to use. Of course, these snippets were customized in my own way to fit the project requirements.

I was stuck on some weird character issue, but I was assisted by Kevin with simple troubleshooting methods. However, 
with Paula's very minor assistance :) - I was able to determined that I had hardcoded a string into one of 
the anaylzers but as soon as I placed the correct value the normal characters for the file path worked. 

Lee assisted with clarifying some of the project requirements as I was having issues interpreting it.

Most of the code entered in this project was taken from my unit 1 labs with some minor adjustments.
